# vc-test-fixtures

A set of test VCs, status lists, and DIDs for testing.

The structure of this repository is mostly self-explanatory. There are three main directories, one each for:

- verifiable credentials
- DIDs
- static bitstring status lists

The verifiable credentials directory is further split into subdirectories with one each for versions 1 and 2 of the verifiable credentials specification, each of which in turn have three subdirectories: one each for the two signature types ed25519-signature-2020 and data-integrity/eddsa-rdfc-2022-cryptosuite and one for vcs with both signatures. Within those directories the VCs themselves are named with following pattern:

[registryType]-[status]-[expiry].json

so like this example:

legacy-noStatus-noExpiry.json 

which means the VC was signed with a DID that is registered in one of our legacy regsitries, most likely the sandbox registry, and has neither a status nor an expiration property.
